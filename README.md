# simpleMathematiGame.github.io
this a simple mathematic game that has been created using windows form (C#)
 
 in this game, you have 4 main buttons that point to a particular row.
if you click on each button, the random number given to you will add
to the selected row.
and in each row, if there are some numbers that sum of them would be an odd number, it will
clear the row.

and for further features, you can see the content of rows' arrays at the left bottom.

for each action that you prefer to do you have a special part of the time which shows on the center bottom.

Finally, your points are collected and displayed at the bottom left.

If your score would be less than 0, you will fail.
